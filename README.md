FamilyFund Connect
A platform where families can pool funds for shared goals (e.g., vacations, family businesses) while having features for real-time communication (chat) and financial tracking. This promotes transparency, trust, and accountability within family finances.
Project Overview:
The platform is a family-centric financial collaboration and communication app designed to promote trust and simplify shared financial goals.
